## Hi there 🎉
I'm a up and coming college graduate who's looking for work, as well as doing some small projects on the side. Things I'm normally working on are:

- The AUREA Census (Currently tidying data)
- The Subgrubs and Snazzards Bot (I update the database for major updates)

You can most easily reach me by email at gomessh@mailbox.org.
